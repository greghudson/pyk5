This code is a work in progress intended to be used eventually in the
MIT krb5 test suite, per:

http://k5wiki.kerberos.org/wiki/Projects/Python_Kerberos_for_testing

This code is not supported or stable.  The commit messages will not be
terribly useful as the version control history will be discarded when
the code is moved into the krb5 repository.
